### Prototype

- Most of the electronics have arrived, so we're planning to set the flight controller up so that we can run a flight sim of the drone, which would allow us to fly a lot more confidently and hopefully avoid crashing!
- The team and I have been working towards getting a CFD analysis of the drone complete, and right now we're in the process of getting preliminary results validated. Based on the response, we will move on to other CFD studies accordingly.
- The technical challenges of creating a drone by bending sheet metal led us down another part, and the plan for the frame is to make it out of foamboard and reinforce with epoxy and fibreglass, which should lead to a more rigid and lightweight frame (although the process ends up being a bit more involved ðŸ˜‹ )
- Unfortunately the motor propeller configuration is not ideal for this use case, and the test results reflect that. Given these results, we've gone back to the drawing board and have found a new combination, where everything is based on literature values, so bench testing is simple a matter of validation rather than assessing the viability of the setup.
- To simplify the manufacturing process, the drone model has been significantly simplified. This allows us to have a much smoother airfoil which leads to better manufacturability and aerodynamics. For any surfacing nerds out there, the shell surface has a perfect G2 continuity, which for now is the best Fusion 360 can offer, so our prototype model should hopefully not require any more modifications (its on version 56 as of this message).

### Website

- Our website team, @Naya and @Jiannine are in the process of updating the website, so hopefully something new should be up in the coming weeks/months.

### Others

- We've just started the process of looking into the best way we can get OpenDrone set up as a legal entity. I'll spare the legal details, partly to not bore everyone, but mostly because I really don't understand most of it myself! The process is quite a difficult one and I really have to thank the helpful team for offering their legal support on this.
- Since the prototype is getting awfully close to completion, we'd be looking forward to getting all the help we can to kickstart the other processes of the project that would become the focus after prototyping. If anyone would like to help out with any aspect of the project, be it CFD or the business plan or even documentation, feel free to reach out to me on Slack. I'd be happy to schedule a call to discuss.

Cheers, and Merry Christmas!
