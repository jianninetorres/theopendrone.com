### Prototype

We're now finalizing all the details for the prototype. The design and electronics are complete and we have sent an official funding request to helpful for the prototype. In the meantime the design, parts, and calculations are all being validated by multiple people who are far more experienced in this field than I am ðŸ˜… . After all the simulations, calculations and validations, we're really hopeful that we can achieve takeoff in first prototype - and move towards the MVP from there.

### Manufacturing

Since the frame build is entirely custom, we're going for either an entirely 3D printed design (if our budget allows it), or a mix of foamboard and 3D printing. The process of deciding was quite extensive, going from 3D printing to manual folding to laser cutting to thermoforming and back to 3D printing - and don't worry, the documentation is all there on the drive! (Please PM me on slack if you don't have access).

### Design Updates

Now that we've got our manufacturing method sorted, the design is being updated to be more friendly to the constraints set by the electronics and manufacturing method/s, and then of course to minimize weight. For a technical overview, here are the changes:

- Sweep reduced to 5 degrees (although when accounting for airfoil size differences it comes to 9.3-15 degrees in calculations.
- The airfoil shape has been straightened to allow for larger propellers
- Ailerons have drastically increased in size to better support vertical-to-horizontal transition
- Wings are an extruded shape to allow for easier manufacturing, calculations, and supports
- Internals rearranged to make design less rear heavy
- Special thanks to @Sandeep for helping me with the calculations and design recommendations

### Electronics

Yes we've finally done electronics! For the drone, we're using a pixhawk controller and building the rest of the control systems around that.

The motors used are 2,200 kV and we're using a 1045 propeller. The battery is a 3S 5200mAh Li-Po. A properly detailed electronics list will be available on the drive once the order has been placed.

### Other Stuff

Although right now the main focus is on getting a prototype out, we still have work being done from the other teams.
We have @Oscar working on the logo, of which initial designs are complete.

@Aria A. and @Vaibhav are working on the structure and text of the new and updated website, and of course we have @Naya actually turning it all into code.

Say hi to our two new project managers @Tolu and @Michael. Look forward to working more closely with both of you!

Hope this was a helpful recap of what all has been going on in the project over the past couple of weeks and look forward to hearing from you guys if you have any inputs, feedback, or suggestions on how we can improve our process, be it on the technical side, website and marketing, or communicating with the team! Cheers!
