### Prototype

- We've gotten in touch with vendors for manufacturing the drone out of sheet metal.
- The design is currently being updated to ensure perfect curvature so that there are no issues with the manufacturing of the design.
- We're working on the CFD analysis of the drone to get more accurate CI/CD values to better support the calculations for takeoff and flight.
- Part of the electronics order has arrived, so we should be able to get thrust values through tests in the coming week.

### Documentation

- Documentation is now being sent to be reviewed by Helpful.

### Other News

- We're now working with Helpful to gain more visibility for the project through articles. We're planning to have some announcements come up around the Feb/March timeline which should hopefully happen shortly after the prototype is complete.
- We're made a basic form to quantitatively bring together the proof of demand and are looking for validation
- We've now started work on getting a proper business model sorted so that we can effectively move to market.
- We're starting work on revamping the website.

Cheers!
