          To repair supply chains in these turbulent times, we are providing a
          safe, contactless, and fast method to deliver essential supplies to
          those who need them. The purpose of this project is to create a
          service where drone delivery can be brought to anyone, anywhere. To
          ensure we're having the greatest impact possible, we're working to
          provide rapid delivery to hospitals in rural areas.

              Weâ€™re building a drone system that does not require any
              infrastructure, allowing us to implement this in remote areas,
              bringing down delivery times from hours to minutes.

              Drone delivery is something that has been worked on for a long
              time, but governments have only recently allowed drone systems to
              operate commercially. What sets us apart is that we're building a
              service for those who are not large enough to do business with the
              giants in the space.

              Instead of building warehouses and large centers, we're focused on
              only bringing what is necessary - the drone itself, so that anyone
              can use delivery, even those in the most remote areas.
